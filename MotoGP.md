I didn't have anything a pre-built package to assist with motorcycle
racing.  Usually that was provided by the world I was playing in.
However, I was able to script together a general purpose physics
package, and load up the model and parameters for the bike, the track
and such.  this wouldn't give me a nice HUD with the optimal racing
line and braking zones, but it would at least tell me how close I was
to losing traction.
