Allison had quite enjoyed learning about the rivalry between Valentino
Rossi and Jorge Lorenzo in the MotoGP races of the late 2000's.  So
she wanted to try it herself, on that class of bikes.


I didn't have anything a pre-built package to assist with motorcycle
racing.  Usually that was provided by the world I was playing in.
However, I was able to script together a general purpose physics
package, and load up the model and parameters for the bike, the track
and such.  This wouldn't give me a nice HUD with the optimal racing
line and braking zones, but it would at least tell me how close I was
to losing traction.



The bike truly felt alive under me.  Which is funny, because I've
ridden Online vehicles that were actually alive, including motorcycles. 
I feel the frame flexing while throwing power to the wheel under
acceleration.
