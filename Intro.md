It was a long flight over the Pacific to my target, and I was bored
and feeling sorry for myself.  My current persona could only afford
sub-sonic travel, hence the long flight.  In-flight Internet access,
even after so much progress in technology, was still expensive and slow
with high latency, so I hadn't signed up for it.

So I just stared out the window at the new lily-pad cities growing on
the ocean, thinking about how I had sunk down to my current situation.

As a kid growing up in the late Twentith, I had loved computers and
astronomy both, and I was lucky to
land my dream job (actually a series of them) at NASA that combined
both fields.  The pinnacle of my career there (and let's be honest, my
life as a whole) was working on the early rover projects to Mars and
the outer planets.

But, just like the robots displaced the poor factory worker, advancing
technology affected me too, despite a Ph.D in Planetary Science and an
MS in Computer Science.  The problem of course was the communications
lag between the rover and the people controlling it.  In my time at
NASA, we had made each successive rover more autonomous and more
independent.  But that wasn't enough.

When true artificial intelligences and uploaded human minds became
possible along with molecular nanotechnology, that changed everything
in the planetary science field, just as it did everywhere else.
Now you could send a smaller probe
faster to the target site and it would (carefully and without
contaminating the moon or planet) grow the exploration
vehicle it needed.  Then we could upload a mind
to the completed probe who got to experience the moon in real time and
conduct experiments.

And who got to actually go on these missions and truly explore
all the different worlds in our solar system?  Was it the guy who
steadfastly refused to accept
the idea that a copy of his mind is just as good as the original?  Or
the up-and-coming punk who only attended Stanford remotely and was
willing to put his brain through a literal meat grinder to digitize
himself?

So he (and the others who uploaded) made the discoveries.  They wrote
the papers, they won the accolades.  And I was pushed aside.  I was
obsolete biological, not much different than a walking, talking dinosaur. 
I was just some old fuddy-duddy who was too attached to his own continuity
of self to be relevant anymore.  And let's be honest, I am still quite
bitter about all of it.

If my old friend Frank was here right now, listening to these
thoughts, I'm sure he'd give me a long talking-to about how good
the future actually turned out.  Back in the day, we had
discussed for hours and hours the impact improving 
technology would have on the human condition.  Like the atom bomb
technology of past generations, it seemed for a while that molecular
nanotechnology would probably be the end of mankind through some
engineered disease or with unconstrained replicators causing an ecological
disaster.  The other main option seemed to be that intelligent machines would
rise up agaist humanity and try to exterminate us like in the movies.

But through the hard work of a new generation of philosophers,
ethicists, and AI researchers in the early Twenty-First, humanity
developed a solid moral and ethical framework for AIs and uploaded
humans to operate in which has so far prevented those sorts of
scenarios.  And while we did have an economic collapse during the
"Singularity", no one starved to death or anything like that.  People were
mostly just standing around trying to figure out what to do next when
they didn't need jobs anymore to support themselves.

All of the AIs and uploads are quite boringly rational and
sensible.  But just because the Machines are relatively nice doesn't
necessarily mean we will be able to live together peaceably.
However, last vestiges of the human world and national governments
were able to reach an accord with the Machines.  In what's since been
called "The Grand Compromise", all parties agreed to rules about
responsible use of all the new technologies.  Everyone on all sides
acknowledged that unconstrained rapid growth which was now possible
was a danger to all.  We agreed to self-imposed limits on how fast we
will grow and expand out into the solar system.

The Machines, it could be argued, got the worse end of the deal.  They
agreed to severe limits on clock speeds and how quickly they would
expand their own minds.  They also gave up all property claims for the
Earth, the Moon, and Mars.  In return they got just Mercury as
completely their own.  The rest of the solar system is in limbo; only
jointly run scientific missions are allowed in the outer system for
now.

The Humans also had to accept some restrictions too, mostly related to
longevity and reproduction.  If you want to have lots of kids, then
you are not allowed to have aging-prevention treatments. When you get
old, you can either just die or upload.  If you truly want to live as
a biological human forever, then you're only allowed one child per
adult.


Looking back, I don't think they really needed to have bothered with
many of those reproductive restrictions.

Most people, in search of entertainment or in some vain search for
meaningful work, venture online.  And once you're on, it becomes
easier to stay online, and harder to leave.

And what is there to do in the real world anyway?  It is just filling
up with fanatics, who aren't much fun to talk to.

So that's why we're building all these lily-pad floating cities out in
the oceans.  This will give enough room for humanity's population to
keep growing... for a while.

The big discussion now is what to do with Venus.  Humans want to
terraform it.

That's why there's been a big discussion about Venus.  Though the
Machines already have Mercury, but they say there isn't enough mass
there to accomplish their goals in the medium term.  And while it has
plenty of solar flux, the mineral composition isn't good for their
needs either. So they want Venus too.

The Human Nation, on the other hand wants to terraform Venus and make
it suitable for biological human habitation, similar
to what has been proposed off and on for years and years.  There are
annoying difficulties in the process, including the lack of a magnetic
field, and its slow rotation.

It will, of
course, take a massive amount of energy and time, and even at the end
of the process, it won't be too long before we fill up that planet
with people.  They also have their eyes on Mars as well.

So the Machines have been arguing that people should just drop all
this biological nonsense, upload, and then as we start the process
of converting Venus to computronium, there will be plenty of room for
everybody for a long, long time.



And so it seems we're still headed for a resource crunch.  Not this
year, not even in the next decade, but soon enough.

Sounds like all our problems are solved, right?

So, even operating in those restrictions, we've got
