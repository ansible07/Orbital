First though, it was time to take a look around the sim in debug mode.

From this viewpoint, it was clear there was only one other person
inside right now, just as expected.  I brought up a millimeter
resolution render, and was looking at a woman.  She was blandly
pretty I suppose;  nowhere close to the extemes of beauty and
ugliness I'm used to seeing Online.  She vaguely reminded me of a
newscaster from way back, but didn't really resemble anyone I'd seen
before.


She was running a bit high with her perceptual bandwidth, over
30Kbytes per second.  Most people don't bother running that high,
because do you really care about the exact texture of the carpet
you're walking on?  Or being able to pick up a handful of sand, and
see all the differently shaped grains?  Usually when you look at
things like sand even in a high-realism sim, your own client will
just render them with some randomness (because looking at identical
little cubes would be wierd).  Here, though, if you look closely
enough, each individual grain is separately simulated and has
persistence.  This is an unbelievable level of detail, normally used
for physics testing.

Damn!  I have what I had previously considered a generous budget to
pay for the extra processing I'll be using while inside the sim, but
this could easly blow that budget and start eating away my bonus.

The shape of the sim was also kind of odd, but it wasn't clear to me
why exactly.
