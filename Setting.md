The Setting
===========

The story takes place in a post-Singularity Earth.  In the early 21st
century, humanity has developed [molecular nanotechnology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_nanotechnology)
and functional [artificial intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence).
By the time these were developed, the Earth's biosphere was heavily
degraded, but not to the point of experiencing an environmental
collapse.  Several quick fixes were rapidly deployed to mitigate the
worst of the problems.  For example, bio-engineered floating trees in
the oceans quickly absorbed the excess CO2 in the water and
atmosphere, preventing the worst aspects of the greenhouse effect.

Most people at this point have either uploaded, or spend 100% of their
time in life support pods, staying Online all the time.

Mars has been settled by humans who are fiercely independent.  They
are pursuing their own colonization without help from the Machines.
In fact, they are bootstraping their entire technology base so as to
be completely free of the Machines' influence.  They are also
bio-engineering themselves to better live in the Martian environment
without needing as much life-support.

The Machines have started converting Mercury into solar-power
computers.  However, they aren't completely happy with this, despite
the high solar flux, the planet's composition is not ideal for their
purposes (too much iron).  They really want Venus too.
