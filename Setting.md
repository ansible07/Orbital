The Setting
===========

The story takes place in a post-Singularity Earth.  In the early 21st
century, humanity has developed [molecular nanotechnology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_nanotechnology)
and functional [artificial intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence).
By the time these were developed, the Earth's biosphere was heavily
degraded, but not to the point of experiencing an environmental
collapse.  Several quick fixes were rapidly deployed to mitigate the
worst of the problems.  For example, bio-engineered floating trees in
the oceans quickly absorbed the excess CO2 in the water and
atmosphere, preventing the worst aspects of the greenhouse effect.


The main groups of humanity:

 * The Uploads.  People who have uploaded themselves and live as software 
alongside the Machines.  Some still live near Earth, but most have emigrated
to Mercury, where there is a lot more compute resources available.
 * The Martians.  Mars has been settled by humans who are fiercely
independent.  They are pursuing their own colonization without help from
the Machines.  In fact, they are bootstraping their entire technology
base so as to be completely free of the Machines' influence.  They are
also bio-engineering themselves to better live in the Martian environment
without needing as much life-support.
 * The Rightous Few.  Actually not so few these days, they number in the
billions.  People who don't go Online and refuse Implants, and try to live
and stay 100% biologically human.  They believe it is their manifest destiny
to go out and settle the universe and spread their god's goodness to
all, but they are still dependent on the Machines for their technological
base, and their efforts have been stymied.  Their numbers keep growing,
however.
 * The Others.  People who have accepted various levels
of Implants, life extension treatments and other modifications.  Most of them
spend the majority of their time Online, usually in life support pods.  So
in that sense it kind of resembles The Matrix, but you may leave at any time.
However, few choose to do so, and in recent years, more and more of them
have been uploading.  There aren't too many people still just walking around
who also go Online.

The Machines have started converting Mercury into solar-power
computers.  However, they aren't completely happy with this, despite
the high solar flux, the planet's composition is not ideal for their
purposes (too much iron).  They really want Venus too.

The Uploads are an interesting case.  As a prerequisite for joining
the larger community and to get fully Online, you have to cleanse
youself of irrational thoughts and behaviors.  It would be easy enough
to just edit an Upload's mentation patterns directly, but this is
un-ethical and considered partial-murder.  So instead most people need
to go through years (usually decades) of training and practice.  Only
then, when they have been able to adapt themselves sufficiently, they
can choose to have their mentation patterns examined and
then be approved for full Online access.  This process is enforced by
the Machines and the current Uploads.
