The Setting
===========

The story takes place in a post-Singularity Earth.  This world is
intended to be what I see as a very best case scenario
for how humanity will progress in the coming years.  Everything turned
out well, while the environment was damaged, it is being repaired.
In the early 21st century, humanity has developed
[molecular nanotechnology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_nanotechnology)
and functional
[artificial intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence),
and done so in a safe and effective manner.  The machines don't want
to kill us, in fact they mostly leave regular humans alone.


By the time these were developed, the Earth's biosphere was heavily
degraded, but not to the point of experiencing an environmental
collapse.  Several quick fixes were rapidly deployed to mitigate the
worst of the problems.  For example, bio-engineered floating trees in
the oceans quickly absorbed the excess CO2 in the water and
atmosphere, preventing the worst aspects of the greenhouse effect.

Of course, even in a nearly perfect world, there will be conflict, and
interesting stories to tell.

The main groups of humanity:

 * The Uploads.  People who have uploaded themselves and live as software 
alongside the Machines.  Some still live near Earth, but most have emigrated
to Mercury, where there is a lot more compute resources available.
 * The Martians.  Mars has been settled by humans who are fiercely
independent.  They are pursuing their own colonization without help from
the Machines.  In fact, they are bootstraping their entire technology
base so as to be completely free of the Machines' influence.  They are
also bio-engineering themselves to better live in the Martian environment
without needing as much life-support.  They are a bit strange already,
and growing more so as the years pass.
 * The Rightous Few.  Actually not so few these days, they number in the
billions.  People who don't go Online and refuse Implants, and try to live
and stay 100% biologically human.  They believe it is their manifest destiny
to go out and settle the universe and spread their god's goodness to
all, but they are still dependent on the Machines for their technological
base, and their efforts have been stymied.  Their numbers keep growing,
however.
 * The Normals.  These are the people that had previously made up the
bulk of society.  They have accepted various levels
of Implants, life extension treatments and other modifications.  Most of them
spend the majority of their time Online, usually in Interface Pods.  So
in that sense it kind of resembles The Matrix, but you may leave at any time.
However, few choose to do so, and in recent years, more and more of them
have been uploading.  There aren't too many people still just walking around
who also go Online.  Their population is still growing, though slowly.
The main reason they haven't Uploaded is a philosophical disagreement
about the continuity of Self when the mind is no longer running on its
original hardware (more on this later).

The Machines have started converting Mercury into solar-power
computers.  However, they aren't completely happy with this, despite
the high solar flux, the planet's composition is not ideal for their
purposes (too much iron).  They really want Venus too.

The main conflict of the story (what there is of it) revolves around
the idea that there isn't much science and engineering talent left on
Earth.  The Rightous Few don't have many interested in that, those who
are usually leave their society quickly.

There are many among the Normals who have this ability and
inclination.  However, as a prerequisite for access to
MNT designs and work on cutting-edge science and engineering projects,
you have to cleanse
youself of irrational thoughts and behaviors.  It would be easy enough
to just edit an Upload's mentation patterns directly, but this is
un-ethical and considered partial-murder.  So instead most people need
to go through years (usually decades) of training and practice.  Only
then, when they have been able to adapt themselves sufficiently, they
can choose to have their mentation patterns examined and
then be approved for full access to all technologies.  This process is
enforced by the Machines.

And as a practical matter, if you're going truly going to contribute,
you need to run at the speed of the Machines, and you need to be close
by to everyone else working in that field.  So that means Uploading,
and transmitting yourself to Mercury.

If a Normal is just interested in creating new virtual worlds or other
software, they can and do stick around as regular humans on Earth.
They are basically just producing content for other Normals, but not
really contibuting to advancing the state of the art in science or
engineering.  There are others building wacky robots out of
Machine-designed components and such, but they are basically
hobbyists.
