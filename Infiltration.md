The link was up and stable.  Next I connected to the target system,
which also went smoothly thanks to my extensive pre-preparation.

I was about to enter the simulation itself, but was stopped because I
didn't have a compatible avatar.  This environment required a fully
detailed body, where I could be simulated down to the quantum level if
necessary.  I had never seen something with such rigorous demands...
this level of detail is hardly necessary for shooting aliens on a
distant planet or a college fraternity simulation.

Fortunately, the designers anticipated this.  I was able to quickly
sketch out an avatar (based on character from one of the Online larceny
sims I had played a while back), and run the solver to create the
genotype and phenotype results.  There were virtualized drivers for my
implants, so I'd have full access to my own tools and expert systems
while experiencing the simulation.  This was especially important
considering I wouldn't be able to access the Internet much while in
there, that would leave too many tracks I'd need to erase later.
