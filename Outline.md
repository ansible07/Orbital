Plot Outline
============

Charles is hired to break in to a high security simulation, to find
out what the Machines are up to.  There he meets Allison, and gets to
know her.  Allison is a new generation of emmisaries created by the
Machines to learn about the remainder of humanity (finally, after
decades of apathy).  Humanity is again headed towards an
overpopulation crisis, and at least a few of the Machines care enough
to try to intervene.  Chairman Zhang is also supposed to meet with
Allison later to talk about his proposal.

Allison and Charles spend a lot of time together, and maybe even start
to fall in love.  This culminates in a late-night design session where
they both work on a new way to solve the looming crisis.  Charles
needs to leave the simulation.  The original plan was to just reset
it, and let it run forward to the point it would have been without
him.  However, this would mean the partial murder of Allison, and the
loss of their combined effort, so he just leaves.  Allison, in the
mean time, has decided to instantiate herself in the Real World ahead
of schedule, to spend more time with Charles.

Charles exits the sim.  Allison, upon exiting the sim herself,
discovers that Charles was an intruder / spy, and not (exactly) who he
said he was.  She confronts him before he gets away, and apparently
kills him in a fit of rage (which is unheard of for a Machine, but
then she was designed and raised to be more human).  As it turns out,
his medical implant does manage to save his life, in a hilarous PoV
scene.

Charles awakes, and is confronted by Chairman Zhang, who has been
aprised of the situation.  On the one hand, they have proof of his
crimes (hacking, espionage).  However, Allison inflicted fatal wounds
upon him, so if he pressed charges, she could be convicted of murder.
They make a deal to have Charles and Allison continue to work on their
mutual design proposals for a few months of subjective time (a couple
days of real time), to present to the Machines to get their help for
the implementation.

As part of the proposal, thousands of terrawatt laser transmitters will
need to be constructed.  After the main construction phase is over,
these will be used to launch starwisps (light sail ships) to start to
colonize other star systems.  Charles and Allison get passage to
Epsilon Indi to explore and look for extraterrestial life, and live
happily ever after.
