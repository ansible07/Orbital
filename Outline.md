Plot Outline
============

Chairman Zhang is working towards the betterment of humanity, and uses
his longstanding relationship with the Machines to get better
technology to allow more people to live on the Earth's limited
resources.  However, his efforts are not shown proper (or really any)
appreciation by the people (the Righteous Few) who benefit the most.
He conceives of a plan to "exterminate" them by creating a new version
of humanity that is more rational in general, having those people mix
with the general population, and through some genetic trickery,
basically breed the v1.0 humans out of existance in 10 generations or
so.  He manages to convince the Machines that this is for the benefit
of all of humanity, and they agree to design humanity v3.0, though
perhaps for their own reasons.

The first "prototypes", v3.0 humans raised by the Machines, are almost
ready.  One of them, Allison, is set to be instantiated in a physical
body in a week, but already there are some unexpected problems.  Zhang
schedules an outside consultant to visit Allison to have another look
at the situation.

Another group has gotten some indication that Chairman Zhang has
started a very secret project.
Charles is hired to break in to a high security simulation (which as
it turns out, just contains Allison), to find
out what the Machines are up to with Chairmant Zhang.  Charles'
employers are also concerned about the future of humanity, and are
worried the Machines may have decided to breach the agreements in the
Grand Compromise.

Inside the simulation, posing as the consultant, Charles meets Allison, and
gets to know her.  Allison is a new generation of humanity created by the
Machines to steer the remainder of humanity in a better direction. 
The Machines want to make humanity more rational, and so have created
Allison and her kin to mix with regular humans, and insert superior
genes into the population (which is mostly what Chairman Zhang wanted).

Many redesigns have been attempted in the past, but this is the
first serious effort by the Machines to do it, and they've done a
complete job.  Stronger, smarter, immune to disease, and all the usual
stuff.  Beyond that, H3.0's mental infrastructure is largely immune to
most cognitive biases, and has the capability to be supremely rational
compared to H1.0.  The goal is to have H3.0 enter the remaining human
population, breed with H1.0, which will then cause the H1.0 to
eventually go extinct, since H3.0 when mixed with H1.0 genes will
overwrite them.

Chairman Zhang has already met some of Allison's kin and seen some
problems with his plan. Raised by
Machine-simulated parents (a requirement imposed by the Machines), Allison
and the other v3.0s are relucant to mix with the RF population,
because of how backwards they are (socially and genetically) even
though we all look alike.  The H3.0s are not that impressed with the
rest of humanity either, because the V1.0s require extensive re-work
to achieve what they have naturally (disease immunity, immortality,
etc.).
It is not at all clear why the Machines
didn't anticipate this problem with their initial design and
upbringing of Allison and the other H3.0 people.  This is what
prompted Chairman Zhang to bring in an outside consultant, who Charlies
has arranged to be delayed, and has substituted himself.

Allison and Charles spend a lot of time together, and maybe even start
to fall in love.  This culminates in a late-night design session where
they both work on a new way to solve the population and resource crisis.  The
population of the Righteous Few is actually not really growing that
fast, because they have a lot of defectors, who leave and go Online
instead.  So even though the Online population doesn't tend to have
children (or if they do, just software ones), the Online population is
still growing substantially.

Initially, they discuss constructing a Culture Orbital.  It isn't
really necessary to construct it out of unobtainium, simply using
steel will do nicely.  They discuss where and how to construct it, but
in Allison's view, the Machines are unwilling to give up Venus to such a
mass-inefficient way of supporting sophonts.

Charles proposes turing the Moon into a narrow Orbital (10km wide by
3.71 million km in diameter), which would
still have twice the land area of the Earth, orbiting the sun
coincident with it (needs active stabilization).  The population of
the Earth could be moved off, and then the Earth could be deconstructed
to make the ring wider to provide drastically more living space.

Probably still too expensive for the Machines to agree with though.

They then talk about constructing a simulated Orbital on the Moon at
1/50th scale.  The entire thing would be a giant, continuous, coherent
simulation of a full-size Orbital.  It would be populated by tiny
compressed people, consisiting of a simulation core and a 1-to-1
mapped miniature human brain.  The grid structure simulates the
envirionment (houses, trees, etc.) and the each sim core simulates the
body of the person or other macro-scale object (like a boat or
airplane).  The entire sim follows the regular laws of
physics (no teleportation or magic) and the reduced size allows speed
of light restictions to be accurately simulated even while running hot
(5x realtime).  It would allow for much greater space for the current
Online population.  Since this is much, much more mass efficient, the
Machines would likely be OK with it and construct it.

Something like this has never been done before.  The Machines have
large, coherent simulation grids, but since all entities are software,
movement around the grid is easy (copying).

They also discuss the means by which the Righteous Few can themselves
be slowly steered away from a population explosion.

Charles now overdue for reporting in to his employers, and needs to
leave the simulation.  The original plan was to just reset
the sim, and let it run hot to the point it would have been without
him.  With clever manipulation of the server logs, and injection of
additional funds to pay for the compute time, 
there should be almost no indication that a break-in even occurred at
all.  It would be the 'perfect crime'.  However, this would mean the
erasure of some of Allison's memories (considered partial murder these
days), and the loss of their
combined design efforts, so with a conflicted heart (and knowing
this will blow his cover) he just leaves.  He can't bear the thought
of harming Allison, nor of destroying the work they've done in their
short time together.  Allison, in the mean time, has decided to
instantiate herself in the Real World ahead of schedule, to spend more
time with Charles offline.

Charles exits the sim.  Allison, surprised by his sudden departure
without adequate explaination (especially so since things between them were seeming
to go so well), upon exiting the sim herself, discovers that Charles was
an intruder / spy, and not (exactly) who he said he was.  Her emotions
are running out of control because her body hasn't finished the final
round of checks and hormone response calibration. She confronts
Charles before he gets away, and apparently kills him in a fit of rage
(which is not supposed to happen with a v3.0).  As it turns out,
Charles' medical implant does manage to save his life, in a hilarous PoV
scene.  The med implant (working with Charles brain pal), try to
continue to escape, but they are immediately caught.  Allison is
distraught, horrified by what she has done.

Charles awakes, and is confronted by Chairman Zhang, who has been
informed of the situation.  On the one hand, they have proof of his
crimes (hacking, espionage, conspiracy for memory erasing).  However,
Allison inflicted fatal wounds
upon him, so if this all went to court, she could be convicted of
murder too.  This is a disaster all around.

However, Chairman Zhang really likes what Allison and Charles have designed
though, and wants to use it to make a full proposal to the Machines
and to the remaining human governments.

They make a deal to have Charles and Allison continue to work on their
mutual design proposal for a few months of subjective time (a couple
days of real time), to present to all sides to get their agreement for
the implementation.  As part of that, Charles will go through the
brain compression process, as will Allison, so that they can run hot.  They
also construct a small simulation grid for them to live in and try out,
and finish the design work.

Initially, the interactions between Allison and Charles are 'frosty'
at best, with all the betrayal and attempted murder in their recent
history.  Both of them get some therapy sessions though, and their
relationship thaws over time.  Their work together tends to run ahead
of schedule, and they start spending more and more of their off-work
time together too.

As part of the proposal, thousands of terrawatt laser transmitters will
need to be constructed.  After the main construction phase is over,
these will be used to launch starwisps (light sail ships) to start to
colonize other star systems, both for machines and compact people. 
Charles and Allison get passage to Epsilon Indi to explore and look for
extraterrestial life, and live happily ever after.
