This is intended to be a hard (very hard) SF novel.  Anything that is
not scientifically accurate is a bug that needs to be fixed.


Constructing an Orbital from the Moon
=====================================

* high-carbon steel ring
* 100m thick
* 100km wide
* 10 million km in diameter
* volume for the ring itself: 3.1415926x10^17 cubic meters
* density of steel: 7850 kg/cubic meter
* total mass: 2.5x10^21 kg

* moon's mass: 7.3477x10^22 kg

The moon is composed of 10 to 20% iron, so this should work.  We might
have to bring in a bit of mass from elsewhere (like the asteroid belt)
but that'll be OK.
