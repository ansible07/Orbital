General
=======

This is intended to be a hard (very hard) SF novel.  Anything that is
not scientifically accurate is a bug that needs to be fixed.

One of the key areas that the writing needs to be improved upon is
"show, don't tell".  Much of the setting and backstory has been
invented, but it is necessary to figure out ways to tell that well.
So instead of having long passages of internal monologue for a
character, it would be better to show what happened.


Constructing an Orbital from the Moon
=====================================

New (smaller) size based on 
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_%28The_Culture%29).

* high-carbon steel ring
* 100m thick
* 100km wide
* 3.71 million km in diameter
* 11.66 million km in circumference 
* volume for the ring itself: 1.166x10^17 cubic meters
* density of steel: 7850 kg/cubic meter
* total mass of ring structure: 9.15x10^20 kg

* moon's mass: 7.3477x10^22 kg

The moon is composed of 10 to 20% iron, so this should work.


Simulated Orbital Size / Mass
=============================

Constructed on a 1/30 scale from actual orbital.

Ring base structural strength not as critical because it is not
being spun for gravity, but merely to maintain tension.

* Still using high-carbon steel ring as base structure.
* 10m thick
* 2km wide
* Using both sides as surface, with a half-twist like a Mobius strip.
* 61833 km in diameter
* 1.237x10^12 cubic meters for ring structure
* density of steel: 7850 kg/cubic meter
* total mass of ring structure: 9.710x10^15 kg

The above diameter may not be the best configuration.  It can be
folded over to reduce the diameter.
