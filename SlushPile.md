Slush Pile
==========

Sometimes it is better to just write it all out, and edit and organize
it later.  Don't expect any of this to be terribly coherent.

Nightclub p0
-------------

So we got ready to go out later tonight.  The nightclub is running a
gaming theme tonight, so guests are to dress up as characters or
something.  Cliche'd... the oldest kind.  But I went with the flow,
because I was trying to humor Allison.

I choose to go as Stammer McGee from 'Highland Mayhem 4', and my twist
on it was to render the costume in Studio Ghibli style.

Nightclub p2
-------------

We moved to one of the lounge areas above the main floor.  There were
a few black couches and a large coffee table in the middle.  One of
the other lounge areas on the other side of the main floor had a few
people in it, but over all this was a relatively secluded spot.


C: "So why not build an actual orbital?"

A: "The costs are just too high."

C: "This is ironic considering we're supposed to be living in a
post-scarcity society."

A: "You know what I mean.  An actual orbital is huge, still kind of
beyond our current capabilities.  It will require a massive amount of
energy."

A: "And there's no way the Machines will sign off of using that much
mass on a dumb matter structure, especially not one of that size."

Compression
-----------

C: "What about that 'compression' technology you said Chairman Zhang
was presenting?"

A: "It is kind of like a new form of upload, designed to address the
concerns some people have about the current process.  Instead of just
freezing your brain and doing a destructive read of your neuronal
structures, it starts out with gene therapy.  There are bunch of steps
in the process, but it starts out with allowing neurons to signal each
other without the use of neurotransmitters, though neurotransmitter
levels will still influence functioning as normal.  Your biology is
shifted away from protein and DNA based to conventional architecture,
but one that is still compatible with the unconverted neurons.  After
the last biological elements have been subsumed, the entire brain can
be physically shrunk, leaving only the transport channels for energy
and repair nanobots."

"So there is no loss of consciousness, and (allegedly) no possible
loss of 'self'.  You are just 'you' the entire time."

C: (speechless, then finally) "Wow, that's amazing."

A: (dismissive) "The Machines don't see the point of it all.  Sure,
you're now running efficently on modern hardware, but then what?  If
you want to go anywhere, you're sending a copy (possibly the exclusive
copy) off somewhere.  And then you'll be running non-continuously on
different hardware.  So you might as well just stay as software from
the start."

Notes: Will probably have the protagonists invent this instead.

Nightclub p3
-------------

A: "So we're back to where we started."

C: "Maybe not.  What if we gave up the idea of being able to simulate
anything?  What if we only simulated a world which has physics
identical to the real world?"

A: "What, so no teleportation, FTL signaling, more than three physical
dimensions?  That sounds boring.  Besides, if each person is stuck in
their own node, they can only interact with people near themselves with
low latency.  Interactions with anyone on a node physically far away
would have noticable lag.  This is totally a solved problem if
everyone converts to software."

C: (still thinking) "What if nodes physically moved in the simulation
grid in response to movement inside the simulation?"

A: "So, say you're in a city, and you want to visit your friend across
town.  The node that runs you would then need to leave the 'building'
you are in, move down the 'street', and then go to the 'building' your
friend is in?"

C: "Yes.  Each 'building' is just a grid frame of nodes with the people
in the building itself and other nodes simulating the building itself
and the nearby environment.  The 'street' might just be a linear
node transport.  Nodes, when moving or stationary, directly connect with
their nearby nodes, so that the person can interact with their local
environment.  Looking at things far away goes through the backbone
network, which adds lag, but that's OK because there would be greater
lag in the real world due to the speed of light."

A: "If the sim grid is built at, say, 1/100th the scale of the
simulated world, the light speed delay should be greater than the
processing and routing delays."


C: "What about structuring the sim to match the topology of what's
being simulated?"

C: "So suppose we decide to simulate a Culture orbital. "

C: "The nodes, which are people, move when the people are moving
through the sim.  That way you keep the lag down.  And its realistic
too, if you're talking to someone thousands of km away in reality,
then there'll be lag there too, that's just the speed of light."

C: "It all depends on what you're simulating, and what
the rules are.  If the sim is completely obeying the physical laws of
the universe, then there are no surpises."

Sudden Interest
---------------

The Trip
--------

Allison walked in, clearly excited.  She had a golden ticket in her
hand, and handed it to Charlie with a flourish.

"What's this?" Charlie looked over the ticket.  "One way ticket, up to
20 light-years.  350 grams.  1kbit/sec up / down quota.  20mW average
power draw."  Charlie looked up quizically. 

C: "Hmmm... 20mW isn't enough for much, unless you're running
reversible logic."

A: "Yes."

C: "But if you were, there's enough mass for a couple compressed minds
and a decent amount of sim space.  Running pretty slow though."

A: (nods)

C: 


A: "I couldn't get us on the closer missions, but Epsilon Indi is one of
the best chances to discover extraterrestrial life!"
