Slush Pile
==========

Sometimes it is better to just write it all out, and edit and organize
it later.  Don't expect any of this to be terribly coherent.

Nightclub p0
-------------

So we got ready to go out later tonight.  The nightclub is running a
gaming theme tonight, so guests are to dress up as characters or
something.  Cliche'd... the oldest kind.  But I went with the flow,
because I was trying to humor Allison.

I choose to go as Stammer McGee from 'Highland Mayhem 4', and my twist
on it was to render the costume in Studio Ghibli style.

...

Allison walked in wearing a faithful rendering of an old video game
character 'Bayonetta' that I'd heard about years and years ago.  The
design was based on fairly standard fantasy and comic tropes of the
time, what with the catsuit's strategic cutouts and such.  She was all
decked out with the accessories the character usually carried, a pair of
large caliber derringer-type pistols on her ankles, and a katana with an
unusual design on her back.

She struck a fashion pose and then spun around to give me a good look. 
All in all, it was nice, but not inspired.

I did smile (there was an old, old part of me that liked this sort of
thing), but I get the sense she picked up that I was not really
impressed though.  She walked up to me with a smirk, brought her left
foot, and unclipped 'Thyme' and handed it to me.

Thyme was fairly hefty, like I expected with a real gun.  The details
(as far as I could tell) were accurate.  I saw that there were a
couple informational overlays available for it, and popped them up in
my field of view.

The first had the details of its implementation within fantasy game
rules.  Allison had documented everything, including the gun's ability
to magically summon bullets at an impressive fire rate.

I wasn't expecting what was in the second overlay, though.  It was a
fully realized design for the gun in the real world.  The level of
detail here was interesting.

Since obviously it couldn't magically summon bullets, there were
provisions for an automatic feed mechanism along the top as well as in the
handle.  So if you sacrificed some of your leg volume, you could have
a fair sized magazine that wouldn't disturb the gun's look while
attached.  It would be the same if you held the gun in your hand.

I started to hand it back to Allison.  "Nice, very nice.  I am
impressed."

Allison smiled at me as she accepted it, and clipped it back on her
ankle.  "I don't have the ammo feeds installed, I'm not planning on
shooting anyone tonight."

She continued as she handed me a pair of white gloves. "Here, put
these on first, and don't let the blade or hilt touch any part of
you."

I was decidedly confused, but complied.  Dirt wasn't really a problem
for most anything we make these days, as putting on a surface that is
auto-cleaning is pretty standard.  And while we were in a higly
realistic simulation, that is one of the common things that is fudged
anyway, unless it is important somehow (like if you're in a gardening
sim).

Allison unclipped the katana from her back (there was no scabbard) and
carefully handed it to me in both hands, with the blade edge facing
up.

I also showed care in holding it with both hands.  For this item there
were three information overlays available.

The first was the fantasy game information as before.  It was a fairly
standard, high-level demonically possed blade.  It granted numerous
speed and strength bonuses, along with the long-term downsides
typically of weapons in this category, including bloodlust and
paranoia.  It was perfect for cutting down hordes of mooks or for a
one-on-one duel with Elric of Melnibone wielding Stormbringer.  Very
nice overall.

I flipped to the next overlay for the real world.  This was a nasty
piece of work.  Allison did not seem to be content with a standard
strong and flexible sword with a sharp edge.  The edge was actually a
series of micro-buzzsaws that would cut through just about anything
below Mohs-8 or so.

She was apparently not content with even that.



Nightclub p2
-------------

We moved to one of the lounge areas above the main floor.  There were
a few black couches and a large coffee table in the middle.  One of
the other lounge areas on the other side of the main floor had a few
people in it, but over all this was a relatively secluded spot.


C: "So why not build an actual orbital?"

A: "The costs are just too high."

C: "This is ironic considering we're supposed to be living in a
post-scarcity society."

A: "You know what I mean.  An actual orbital is huge, still kind of
beyond our current capabilities.  It will require a massive amount of
energy."

A: "And there's no way the Machines will sign off of using that much
mass on a dumb matter structure, especially not one of that size."

Compression
-----------

C: "What about that 'compression' technology you said Chairman Zhang
was presenting?"

A: "It is kind of like a new form of upload, designed to address the
concerns some people have about the current process.  Instead of just
freezing your brain and doing a destructive read of your neuronal
structures, it starts out with gene therapy.  There are bunch of steps
in the process, but it starts out with allowing neurons to signal each
other without the use of neurotransmitters, though neurotransmitter
levels will still influence functioning as normal.  Your biology is
shifted away from protein and DNA based to conventional architecture,
but one that is still compatible with the unconverted neurons.  After
the last biological elements have been subsumed, the entire brain can
be physically shrunk, leaving only the transport channels for energy
and repair nanobots."

"So there is no loss of consciousness, and (allegedly) no possible
loss of 'self'.  You are just 'you' the entire time."

C: (speechless, then finally) "Wow, that's amazing."

A: (dismissive) "The Machines don't see the point of it all.  Sure,
you're now running efficently on modern hardware, but then what?  If
you want to go anywhere, you're sending a copy (possibly the exclusive
copy) off somewhere.  And then you'll be running non-continuously on
different hardware.  So you might as well just stay as software from
the start."

Notes: Will probably have the protagonists invent this instead.

Nightclub p3
-------------

A: "So we're back to where we started."

C: "Maybe not.  What if we gave up the idea of being able to simulate
anything?  What if we only simulated a world which has physics
identical to the real world?"

A: "What, so no teleportation, FTL signaling, more than three physical
dimensions?  That sounds boring.  Besides, if each person is stuck in
their own node, they can only interact with people near themselves with
low latency.  Interactions with anyone on a node physically far away
would have noticable lag.  This is totally a solved problem if
everyone converts to software."

C: (still thinking) "What if nodes physically moved in the simulation
grid in response to movement inside the simulation?"

A: "So, say you're in a city, and you want to visit your friend across
town.  The node that runs you would then need to leave the 'building'
you are in, move down the 'street', and then go to the 'building' your
friend is in?"

C: "Yes.  Each 'building' is just a grid frame of nodes with the people
in the building itself and other nodes simulating the building itself
and the nearby environment.  The 'street' might just be a linear
node transport.  Nodes, when moving or stationary, directly connect with
their nearby nodes, so that the person can interact with their local
environment.  Looking at things far away goes through the backbone
network, which adds lag, but that's OK because there would be greater
lag in the real world due to the speed of light."

A: "If the sim grid is built at, say, 1/100th the scale of the
simulated world, the light speed delay should be greater than the
processing and routing delays."


C: "What about structuring the sim to match the topology of what's
being simulated?"

C: "So suppose we decide to simulate a Culture orbital. "

C: "The nodes, which are people, move when the people are moving
through the sim.  That way you keep the lag down.  And its realistic
too, if you're talking to someone thousands of km away in reality,
then there'll be lag there too, that's just the speed of light."

C: "It all depends on what you're simulating, and what
the rules are.  If the sim is completely obeying the physical laws of
the universe, then there are no surpises."

Sudden Interest
---------------

The Trip
--------

Allison walked in, clearly excited.  She had a golden ticket in her
hand, and handed it to Charlie with a flourish.

"What's this?" Charlie looked over the ticket.  "One way ticket, up to
20 light-years.  350 grams.  1kbit/sec up / down quota.  20mW average
power draw."  Charlie looked up quizically. 

C: "Hmmm... 20mW isn't enough for much, unless you're running
reversible logic."

A: "Yes."

C: "But if you were, there's enough mass for a couple compressed minds
and a decent amount of sim space.  Running pretty slow though."

A: (nods)

C: 


A: "I couldn't get us on the closer missions, but Epsilon Indi is one of
the best chances to discover extraterrestrial life!"


Chairman Zhang Intro
--------------------

CZ and a few others are at an opening ceremony for a new type of
habitat.  Long-term partnet Mei-Mei is there and a few others from his
organization.

The new design is a lily pad city.  New design will allow for good
expansion of human population on Earth.  Few appreciate it though.

This puts CZ in a contemplative mood.  He wants to steer humanity to a
better path, and avoid the looming population crisis.

Stares out to sea.  A plan begins to form in his mind.
